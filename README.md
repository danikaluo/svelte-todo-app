Instructions:
To add items to the todo list, users can input text into the text box and press add or hit the enter key to add the item to the list. The button with a check allows the user to mark items as completed. The button with an x deletes the item from the list when pressed.

Reflection:
Svelte is a JavaScript framework for making interactive webpages and web applications. Svelte is different that previous technologies because it runs at build time, which converts the components into highly efficient  code that updates the DOM. This means less complex code, which saves time and increases readability. Firebase is a Google product that is a mobile application development platform that helps users build and improve application. It was a very useful tool for storing app data in a dataset and it was easily modified by calling certain functions that connected the javascript to the data and you can see real time changes. It also allows data to be stored across users.
